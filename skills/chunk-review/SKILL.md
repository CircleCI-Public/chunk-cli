# Chunk Review Skill

Use the team's generated review prompt to review recent code changes.

## Steps

1. **Load the review prompt**: Read `.chunk/review-prompt.md` from the root of the current project. If it does not exist, tell the user and suggest they run `chunk build-prompt` to generate one.

2. **Determine the diff scope**: Use the following priority order to decide what to review:
   - If the user specified a commit range, branch, or file list — use that
   - If there are staged changes (`git diff --cached`) — review those
   - Otherwise, review uncommitted changes against the main branch (`git diff main...HEAD` or `git diff origin/main...HEAD`)

3. **Get the diff**: Run `git diff` with the appropriate scope to obtain the changes. If the diff is empty, tell the user there is nothing to review.

4. **Apply the review prompt**: Use the standards, rules, and patterns from `.chunk/review-prompt.md` as your review criteria. Do not invent additional criteria beyond what is in the prompt.

5. **Produce the review**: Follow the response format specified in the review prompt exactly.

## Notes

- The `.chunk/review-prompt.md` file is generated by `chunk build-prompt` and encodes the team's actual review patterns mined from real PR comments. Treat it as the authoritative source of review standards.
- If `.chunk/review-prompt.md` is missing, do not fall back to generic review criteria — prompt the user to generate it first.
- Keep review feedback grounded in the diff. Do not comment on code that was not changed.
